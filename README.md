# HAFAS Checksum Calculator

There is the german company [HaCon](https://hacon.de) selling their software [HAFAS](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAFAS) to public transport companies like the biggest german Train Transport operator [Deutsche Bahn](https://deutschebahn.com).

HAFAS wants a checksum on each request. I built this small tool to verify my own implementation.
